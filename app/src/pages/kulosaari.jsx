            <h3>Monday, May 15, 2023</h3>
            <h4>Lunchroom, Kulosaari Secondary School</h4>
            <p>
              Linda Ekl√∂f, an upper secondary math teacher and the school's
              international coordinator, joined my table for lunch. We discussed
              the role of tech at Kulosaari.

                Q: Which grade do students begin their compulsory programming
                courses at Kulosaari?
              </b>
              <br></br>
              "In 7th grade, they start programming. But we include logic and
              problem-solving concepts in mathematics and other courses. We also
              offer robotics where students learn Python."
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <b>
                Q: How often do your students have laptops in the classroom?
              </b>
              <br></br>
              "All of the upper secondary students use laptops with a lock-down
              browser for tests. And they are used frequently for other work."
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <b>
                Q: Does Kulosaari provide laptops? Or do students bring their
                own?
              </b>
              <br></br>
              "Since laptops are required for tests, we provide all upper
              secondary students with school issued laptops. The 7th grade
              students also have school-provided laptops. For anything that is
              compulsory, we are mandated to give all students access to the
              technology/books/tools they need."
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <b>
                Q: What is the most recent tech-investment made by the school?
              </b>
              <br></br>
              "Big tech investments for the school are made to adapt to the
              changing climate. During COVID, we bought 400 new laptops for the
              students--we used to have 400 Chromebooks. And to support the
              growing population of our school, we added the new
              building--Building A, which has Artome projectors."
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <b>
                Q: Have you experienced issues related to the use of AI to
                complete assignments?
              </b>
              <br></br>
              "Perhaps some of the other teachers have. But it is difficult to
              measure."

            <h2>A Grounded Approach to Tech Educationüîã</h2>
            <p>
              Despite a focus on technology, the Finnish education system
              emphasizes nature as a learning environment. The Finnish
              government recommends that schools should be no farther than 300
              meters from green areas (Source:{" "}
              <a href="https://otter-project.eu/blog/post/11/education-outside-the-classroom-the-finnish-way">
                The Otter-Project
              </a>
              ). As expected, every school we visited was located near a forest
              or park. Nature in Finland is used to provide learning
              opportunities for math, science, language, art, physical
              education, and even technology.
